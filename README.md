## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying drugs based on patient characteristics using a Decision Tree classifier. The project leverages Python and popular data science libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To implement a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn to predict drug type.
- To train, test, and evaluate the model on a dataset of patient characteristics and corresponding drug prescriptions.
- To visualize the decision tree for interpretability.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project, `drug200.csv`, contains data on 200 patients, including age, sex, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol levels, the ratio of sodium to potassium, and the drug type prescribed. The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Age`: Age of the patient.
- `Sex`: Gender of the patient (F or M).
- `BP`: Blood Pressure level (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH).
- `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol level (NORMAL, HIGH).
- `Na_to_K`: Ratio of sodium to potassium in the blood.
- `Drug`: Type of drug prescribed.

### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `Python 3.x`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/drug-classification-decision-tree.git
cd drug-classification-decision-tree
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
To use this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/drug-classification-decision-tree.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd drug-classification-decision-tree
    ```
3. Run the classification script:
    ```bash
    python classify_drug.py
    ```

## Modeling
The modeling process involves the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset and understand its structure.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert categorical variables to numerical values using label encoding.
3. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. **Model Training**: Train a Decision Tree model using the training set.
5. **Model Prediction**: Make predictions on the test set using the trained model.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using the test dataset. The key metrics used for evaluation include:

- **Accuracy**: This metric indicates the proportion of correct predictions made by the model out of all predictions.
    ```python
    from sklearn import metrics
    print("Decision Tree's Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_testset, predTree))
    ```

### Example Code
Here is an example of how to evaluate the model using accuracy:

```python
from sklearn import metrics

# Assuming y_testset contains the actual values and predTree contains the predicted values
print("Decision Tree's Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_testset, predTree))
```

## Visualizing the Decision Tree
The trained Decision Tree model can be visualized using the `export_graphviz` function from scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.tree import export_graphviz

# Visualize the decision tree
export_graphviz(drugTree, out_file='tree.dot', filled=True, feature_names=['Age', 'Sex', 'BP', 'Cholesterol', 'Na_to_K'])
```
